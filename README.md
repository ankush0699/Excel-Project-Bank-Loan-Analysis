## Problem Statement

In order to monitor and assess our bank's lending activities and performance, we need to create a comprehensive Bank Loan Report. This report aims to provide insights into key loan-related metrics and their changes over time. The report will help us make data-driven decisions, track our loan portfolio's health, and identify trends that can inform our lending strategies.

## Dashboard 1: Summary

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

**Total Loan Applications:**
- Calculate the total number of loan applications received during a specified period.
- Monitor the Month-to-Date (MTD) Loan Applications.
- Track changes Month-over-Month (MoM).

**Total Funded Amount:**
- Understand the total amount of funds disbursed as loans.
- Monitor the MTD Total Funded Amount.
- Analyze MoM changes in this metric.

**Total Amount Received:**
- Track the total amount received from borrowers to assess the bank's cash flow and loan repayment.
- Analyze the MTD Total Amount Received.
- Observe MoM changes.

**Average Interest Rate:**
- Calculate the average interest rate across all loans.
- Monitor MTD average interest rate.
- Track MoM variations.

**Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI):**
- Evaluate the average DTI for borrowers to gauge their financial health.
- Compute the average DTI for all loans.
- Track MoM fluctuations.

### Good Loan vs. Bad Loan KPIs

**Good Loan KPIs:**
- **Good Loan Application Percentage:** Calculate the percentage of loan applications classified as 'Good Loans' (status: 'Fully Paid' and 'Current').
- **Good Loan Applications:** Identify the total number of 'Good Loan' applications.
- **Good Loan Funded Amount:** Determine the total amount of funds disbursed as 'Good Loans'.
- **Good Loan Total Received Amount:** Track the total amount received from borrowers for 'Good Loans'.

**Bad Loan KPIs:**
- **Bad Loan Application Percentage:** Calculate the percentage of loan applications categorized as 'Bad Loans' (status: 'Charged Off').
- **Bad Loan Applications:** Identify the total number of 'Bad Loan' applications.
- **Bad Loan Funded Amount:** Determine the total amount of funds disbursed as 'Bad Loans'.
- **Bad Loan Total Received Amount:** Track the total amount received from borrowers for 'Bad Loans'.

### Loan Status Grid View

To gain a comprehensive overview of our lending operations, we will create a grid view report categorized by 'Loan Status'. This report will analyze key indicators associated with different loan statuses, including 'Total Loan Applications,' 'Total Funded Amount,' 'Total Amount Received,' 'MTD Funded Amount,' 'MTD Amount Received,' 'Average Interest Rate,' and 'Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI)'.
